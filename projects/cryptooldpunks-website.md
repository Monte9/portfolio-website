I was involved with the NFT project CryptoOldPunks. I noticed the project didn't have a landing page.

I reached out to the creator and offered to build a website for him. He agreed.

We worked together to figure out what he wanted on the website.

I built it in over a weekend (2 days) and the website was live in less than a week from when we talked about it.
