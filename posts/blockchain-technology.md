While conversing with a friend recently, I asked him if he had heard about Blockchain. He was puzzled and replied “What’s that?”. I didn’t have a good answer to that and by the end of our conversation, he was more confused about what Blockchain was than before.

In this post, I am going to briefly explain Blockchain as best as I understand it, and then discuss one specific application of this technology in the near future.

## What is Blockchain?

> *Blockchain is a decentralized database that stores a registry of transactions (and assets) across a peer-to-peer network.*

Let’s break that down:

1. **decentralized system:** is one in which the information/resources are allocated across individual actors or nodes of a network.
2. **registry of transactions:** aka storing a trail of all your actions such that it can be traced all the way back to its origin. It’s important to note that this registry is immutable in nature and uni-directional.
3. **peer-to-peer network:** it’s a network in which each actor/node has a relationship with several other actors in the network. Think of it as a many-to-many relationship (Facebook) as oppose to many-to-one relationship (Bank).

## What is Bitcoin?

Like paper money and gold before it, Bitcoin is a currency that allows parties to exchange value. Although unlike it predecessors, **Bitcoin is digital and decentralized**.

Think of Bitcoin as the application of the Blockchain technology in one specific domain as a financial currency.

## What is Ethereum?

> *Ethereum is an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications.*

What this means is that it’s a framework or an abstraction over the Blockchain technology. So you could build a Bitcoin-like application on the Ethereum network without necessarily having to worry about writing the Blockchain technology from scratch.

Here’s a flow-chart which shows how Blockchain, Ethereum and Bitcoin are related to one another.
